Microscale field data is stored within the *_griddata.mat files in the 
form of cell arrays. To access the data, follow these steps: 
 
1) Change the current Matlab folder to the folder which contains the *_griddata.mat file 
 
2) At the prompt, load the file contents into the workspace using the command >>load *_griddata.mat 
 
3) The cell arrays for stresses and strain rates are 3D, whereas those for viscosity and power 
dissipation density are 2D. Desired data can be accessed as follows: 
    -access griddata for STRESSES using the syntax form "micro_stress{i,j,k}"  where i refers to the 
     temperature interval, j refers the applied macro strain rate or stress interval, and k is as follows: 
          k=1 for deviatoric sigma_11 
          k=2 for deviatoric sigma_22 
          k=3 for deviatoric sigma_33 
          k=4 for tau_32 
          k=5 for tau_31 
          k=6 for tau_12 
          k=7 for max. principal dev. stress sigma1p 
          k=8 for min. principal dev. stress sigma3p 
          k=9 for max. shear stress 
          k=10 for 2nd invariant of stress 
          k=11 for trace of stress tensor (which can be used to obtain normal components)
    -access griddata for STRAIN RATES using the syntax form "micro_strain{i,j,k}"  where i refers to the 
     temperature interval, j refers the macro strain rate interval, and k is as follows: 
          k=1 for epsdot_11 
          k=2 for epsdot_22 
          k=3 for epsdot_33 
          k=4 for gammadot_32 
          k=5 for gammadot_31 
          k=6 for gammadot_12 
          k=7 for max. principal strain rate epsdot_1p 
          k=8 for min. principal strain rate epsdot_3p 
          k=9 for 2nd strain rate invariant 
          k=10 for trace of strain rate tensor (which can be used to obtain normal components) 
    -access griddata for VISCOSITIES or POWER DISSIPATION DENSITIES using the syntax formd "micro_visc{i,j}" 
     or "micro_pdd{i,j}" where i refers to the temperature interval and j refers the applied macro strain rate or stress interval.
